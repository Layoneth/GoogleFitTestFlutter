So, the weight, step count and the height will be shown in he screen in a list of text. Additionally, the can sign out pressing in the button "Sign out" and tapping again in "FitData" button could access again and see the data in the screen

Finally, mentiont that maybe you will see a kind of bug when you sign out and tap in FitData the is loading, you just have to tap again and it will work. And as I used FitKit library, it doesn't support some feature like step counter, so in that case I could research about that and maybe try to it natively.
